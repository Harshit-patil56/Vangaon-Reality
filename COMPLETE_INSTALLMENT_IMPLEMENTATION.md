# Complete Installment System Implementation

## Summary
A comprehensive installment payment system has been implemented with proper backend logic for splitting payments and enhanced frontend UI for viewing and managing installments across all payment pages.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. New API Endpoints

#### POST `/api/payments/{deal_id}/split-installments`
- **Purpose**: Split a payment into multiple installments
- **Features**:
  - Creates multiple payment records with installment metadata
  - Supports custom amounts and dates for each installment
  - Validates total amounts and installment counts
  - Links all installments through `parent_amount` and `total_installments` fields

#### GET `/api/payments/{deal_id}/{payment_id}/installments`
- **Purpose**: Retrieve all installments for a payment plan
- **Features**:
  - Returns complete installment timeline
  - Includes payment status and dates
  - Provides installment progress information

### 2. Database Schema
- `is_installment` (BOOLEAN): Marks payment as part of installment plan
- `installment_number` (INT): Current installment number (1, 2, 3...)
- `total_installments` (INT): Total number of installments in plan
- `parent_amount` (DECIMAL): Total amount of entire installment plan

### 3. Enhanced Payment Creation
- Updated main payment creation endpoint to handle installment fields
- Proper validation for installment metadata
- Support for linking installments through parent_amount

   - Check installment context information
   - Test form functionality

4. **List Integration**: 
   - View payment list for deals with installments
   - Verify badges and progress indicators
   - Test search and filtering with installments
